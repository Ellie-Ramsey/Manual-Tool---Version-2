This is the manual version of the Ramsey Systems Exmaple Patient Creator programme. This si the second stable version of the programme - changes in UI, functionalities and JSON fstructure are going to be made in the future.

Potential Future Things:
- import bug with drop down, im not sure if it's real but yeah somehting to come back to
- weird bug with the files having to be a certain way around (might not be relevant though)


- move a row around
- insert below
- make import export one file


- do i need to add the standard URL and standard name
- do we need sheet
- are squares all of the editable stuff

- look for how many square brackets there are, add text boxes for each one





To Do:

STANDARDS:
- change to a combobox
   (need to have a qay to search the data paths drop down)
- - need to have it so that the drop down automatically has values
