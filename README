This is the manual version of the Ramsey Systems Exmaple Patient Creator programme. This si the second stable version of the programme - changes in UI, functionalities and JSON fstructure are going to be made in the future.

Potential Future Things:
- import bug with drop down, im not sure if it's real but yeah somehting to come back to
- weird bug with the files having to be a certain way around (might not be relevant though)


- move a row around
- insert below
- make import export one file





To Do:

JSON CHANGE:
- need to change the import structure
  - ask about the inclusion of the 'standard' + URL part (if yes will need to update all of the story functionality)
  
- need to change the export structure




- need to have it so that the drop down automatically has values
- put JSON button at the bottom
