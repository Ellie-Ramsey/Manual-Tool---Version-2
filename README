This is the manual version of the Ramsey Systems Exmaple Patient Creator programme. This si the second stable version of the programme - changes in UI, functionalities and JSON fstructure are going to be made in the future.


Potential Future Things:
- look at for app engine, need to have a way to save name user specific

- move a row around
- insert below

- be able to deal with incorrect dataPath values


Current Focus:
- write a little test script for things to test

- add a catch error when the value of dataPath is empty which means that they need to change it
   - need for them to know something is wrong
